🔒Password Strength Checker🔒
With the help of Tkinter, this code creates a Password Strength Checker 🔒 that lets users assess the security of their passwords instantly.
As users type ✍, it provides immediate feedback while checking for important parameters like length, capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
To improve usability, a "peekaboo" feature allows users to toggle password visibility 👁.
In order to help users create stronger passwords, the application also highlights common weak passwords and patterns 💪. 
All in all, it provides an easy-to-use interface to enhance password security! 🛡
